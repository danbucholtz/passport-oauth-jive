passport-jive
===================

Example coming soon.  This is a Passport.js plugin that allows for a Jive add-on and instance to be used in conjuction to perform authentication.  It makes it very easy to secure your add-on server's endpoints and limit access to valid jive users.  Passport is the leading node-based authentication solution.
